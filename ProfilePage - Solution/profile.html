    <p>
      Along with Riccardo, Roger and Lauren, it is my job to ensure you leave CSSI with the confidence and skills
      you need to take on the world! I studied engineering at the University of Illinois
      [amazing school for all of you future Illini!] and then worked as a SQL developer after graduating.
      4 years ago, I  moved to New Orleans to teach middle school science and math (with a little CS thrown in).
      I just moved back to the best city in the world- Chicago, a few weeks ago and have enjoyed every second of being back home.
      Can't wait for CSSI CHI!
