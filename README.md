#HTML Personal Webpage LAB
Open your index.html file in your my_website directory
#Boiler plate code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>   
  <head> 
    <title> My personal webpage! </title>   
  </head>   
  <body>
    <h1>Heading</h1> 
    <p>Some text about you! </p> 
  </body> 
<html>
```
#Adding sections
For your new personal website all about you! Somethings you can include are: a short bio, your hobbies, fact about your future college etc. Your html webpage should include
+ a title
+ a subheader (using h2-h6 tags)
+	a p tag with a short paragraph
+	an image
+	a link

#Stretch: Adding pages
Add additional pages to your site by creating three separate html files
+	To link to pages in the same site, use an `<a>` tag.
+	If your site has index.html and aboutme.html and they're in the same directory, a link on the index.html to aboutme.html looks like this
`<a href="my_website/aboutme.html">About Me Page</a>`
+ This is a relative link.
+	Put links in an unordered list using `ul` and `li` tags
