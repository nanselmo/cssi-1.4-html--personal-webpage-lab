        Along with Riccardo, Roger and Lauren, it is my job to ensure you leave CSSI with the confidence and skills
        you need to take on the world! I studied engineering at the University of Illinois
        [amazing school for all of you future Illini!] and then worked as a SQL developer after graduating.
        4 years ago, I  moved to New Orleans to teach middle school science and math (with a little CS thrown in).
        I just moved back to the best city in the world- Chicago, a few weeks ago and have enjoyed every second of being back home.
        Can't wait for CSSI CHI!
